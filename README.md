## 📌 About

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where participants take turns placing their symbols (“X” or “O”) on a 3×3 grid. The game automatically determines a winner when three identical symbols align horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or declares a draw when no valid moves remain.

This project is designed for learning and demonstrating fundamental frontend development skills.
